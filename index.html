       <h2>About</h2>
       <p>
Glitch Gobblers is a 2D maze game with a Viking twist. You wake inside a fortress-like maze and need to find your way out before the clock runs down. The goal is simple: escape — but the path is not. The map blends university-like spaces with winding corridors and tight routes.
<br><br>
There are obstacles, both visible and hidden: locked paths, spiked floors, and secret passages that only appear when you’re paying attention (or just lucky). Not all encounters slow you down either — some items help you move faster or survive the next challenge.
<br><br>
The timer matters. The default run is five minutes, and difficulty levels adjust the time to raise or lower the pressure. The game starts paused and can be paused at any moment, keeping the experience casual and fair.
<br><br>
You win by escaping and making it “home” after finding your way out. Sprint straight for the exit, or explore for helpful boosts and risk a longer route. Beat the clock, outsmart the maze, and prove you’re not meant to wander university halls forever.
